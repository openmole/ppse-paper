    abstract = {Models of emergent phenomena are designed to provide an explanation to global-scale phenomena from local-scale processes. Model validation is commonly done by verifying that the model is able to reproduce the patterns to be explained. We argue that robust validation must not only be based on corroboration, but also on attempting to falsify the model, i.e. making sure that the model behaves soundly for any reasonable input and parameter values. We propose an open-ended evolutionary method based on Novelty Search to look for the diverse patterns a model can produce. The Pattern Space Exploration method was tested on a model of collective motion and compared to three common a priori sampling experiment designs. The method successfully discovered all known qualitatively different kinds of collective motion, and performed much better than the a priori sampling methods. The method was then applied to a case study of city system dynamics to explore the model’s predicted values of city hierarchisation and population growth. This case study showed that the method can provide insights on potential predictive scenarios as well as falsifiers of the model when the simulated dynamics are highly unrealistic.},

abstract = {Though the sheer volume of data that is collected is immense, it is the rare categories that are often the most important in many high-impact domains, ranging from financial fraud detection in online transaction networks to emerging trend detection in social networks, from spam image detection on social media platforms to rare disease diagnosis in medical decision support systems. The unique challenges of rare category analysis include (1) the highly skewed class distribution; (2) the non-separable nature of the rare categories from the majority classes; (3) data and task heterogeneity; and (4) the time-evolving property of the input data sources. This survey reviews state-of-the-art techniques used in complex rare category analysis, where the majority classes have a smooth distribution while the minority classes exhibit the compactness property in the feature space or subspace. Rare category analysis aims to identify, characterize, represent, and interpret anomalies that not only show statistical significance but also exhibit interesting patterns (e.g., compactness, high-order structures, showing in a burst). We introduce our study, define the problem setting, and describe the unique challenges of complex rare category analysis. We then present a comprehensive review of recent advances that are designed for this problem setting, from rare category exploration without any label information to rare category exposition that characterizes rare examples with a compact representation, from the representation of rare patterns in a salient embedding space to the interpretation the prediction results and providing relevant clues for the end-users’ interpretation. Finally we discuss potential challenges and shed light on the future directions for complex rare category analysis.1},

abstract = {Efficient sampling strategies that scale with the size of the problem, computational budget, and users’ needs are essential for various sampling-based analyses, such as sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. In this study, we propose a new strategy, called Progressive Latin Hypercube Sampling (PLHS), which sequentially generates sample points while progressively preserving the distributional properties of interest (Latin hypercube properties, space-filling, etc.), as the sample size grows. Unlike Latin hypercube sampling, PLHS generates a series of smaller sub-sets (slices) such that (1) the first slice is Latin hypercube, (2) the progressive union of slices remains Latin hypercube and achieves maximum stratification in any one-dimensional projection, and as such (3) the entire sample set is Latin hypercube. The performance of PLHS is compared with benchmark sampling strategies across multiple case studies for Monte Carlo simulation, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Our results indicate that PLHS leads to improved efficiency, convergence, and robustness of sampling-based analyses.}
